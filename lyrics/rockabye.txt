Call it love and devotion
Call it the mom's adoration (foundation)
A special bond of creation, hah
For all the single moms out there
Going through frustration
Clean Bandit, Sean-Da-Paul, Anne-Marie, sing, make them hear
She works the night by the water
She's gone astray, so far away from her father's daughter
She just wants a life for her baby
All on her own, no one will come
She's got to save him (daily struggle)
She tells him, "Ooh, love
No one's ever gonna hurt you, love"
"I'm gonna give you all of my love"
"Nobody matters like you" (stay up there, stay up there)
She tells him, "Your life ain't gonna be nothing like my life" (straight)
"You're gonna grow and have a good life"
"I'm gonna do what I got to do" (stay up there, stay up there)
So, rockabye, baby, rockabye

Rockabye, baby, don't you cry
